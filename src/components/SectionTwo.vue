            <p>I’m glad to see you visit my website. Okay, let me introduce myself :) My fullname is Murodov Azizmurod and I'm Web Developer from Navoi, Uzbekistan with more than 2 years of experience. I’m only 16 years old. I am code using many techlogies as Python3, JavaScript, PHP, SQL and Git.</p>
            <p>Initially I started as a programmer from learning PHP and at that time I had some books about PHP. Then, through the One Million Uzbek Programmers project, I became interested in Python, and the language attracted me. So now the main language for writing code is Python, after HTML, of course :)</p>
